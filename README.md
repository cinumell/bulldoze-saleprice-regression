# Bulldozer sale price prediction using regression

In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

We're going to take the following approach:
* Problem definition 
* Data 
* Evaluation 
* Features 
* Modelling 
* Experimentation

## Data
The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

## Evaluation
For more on the evaluation of this project check: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation

The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error. For example, our goal for this project will be to build a machine learning model which minimises RMSLE.
